This script calculates the Rate of Agreement (RoA) between motor units 
identified by two different operators based on their discharge timings.

The RoA is computed for each pair of motor units, comparing the discharges 
from both operators within a specified tolerance. The results are printed 
for each motor unit.

Requirements:
- openhdemg.library: This library is used for loading and processing EMG data.
